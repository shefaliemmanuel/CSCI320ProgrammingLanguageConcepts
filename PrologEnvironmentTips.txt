  Notice that the instructions for the Mac tell you to install xquartz.
  I did this too:

Instructions for Unix and Windows are at

--------  
General:
--------
Type 
help.
at the command prompt inside Prolog for a linked manual.
(This seems to be oriented towards Unix and Windows.)

Type 
halt.
to stop Prolog.

Consulting a File
--------------------------
Prolog people use the word 'consult' to refer to loading the file into
the Prolog interpeter.

To consult a file such as test.pl, give the whole path in 
single quotes. Example:
?- ['/Users/yuliakahl/CS320-ProgrammingLanguages/Prolog/test'].
(Or use the GUI on the Mac as described below.)

To reconsult a file:
?- reconsult('/Users/yuliakahl/CS320-ProgrammingLanguages/Prolog/test').

Multiple files can be consulted to give Prolog knowledge from different 
sources.  

I typed 
ls.
inside Prolog to give me an idea of where I was as far as my path and
it worked.

On a Mac:

(It is entirely possible that this works for other systems, but I have 
not checked.)

Once you've downloaded Prolog and XQuartz, launch Prolog from Applications.
If you use the GUI, you don't have to type the whole path to consult files.

If you've previously created a file using your own editor, go to 
File --> Consult,
and select it.
You can also go to 
File --> Edit, 
and select an existing file to work with using their editor.
If you wish to create a new file using their editor, go to 
File --> New,
type in a name and where to save it.

Note that if you are in the editor, you will not see the option to 
consult your file. Remember to click on the Prolog window to see the 
its menu. 

If you make changes to your file in the editor, make sure to click on
File --> Reload modified files
to re-consult the program. 

Up-arrow retypes you last command at the prompt. (Keep pressing for the
next-to-last, etc.)
